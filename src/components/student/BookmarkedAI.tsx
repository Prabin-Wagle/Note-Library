The main challenge students face is properly setting up the conversion factors and maintaining unit consistency throughout multi-step problems.",
      'Thermodynamics calculations': "Thermodynamics deals with energy transformations in chemical systems. Key equations include ΔG = ΔH - TΔS and ΔG = -RTlnK. The concept often confuses students because it involves abstract thinking about energy changes that aren't directly observable.",

The difficulty lies in understanding electron movement (mechanisms) rather than memorizing individual reactions. Focus on recognizing patterns of reactivity based on electron-rich and electron-poor sites.",

The Nernst equation (E = E° - (RT/nF)lnQ) is crucial for understanding non-standard conditions. Students often struggle with determining cell potentials and predicting spontaneity of redox reactions.",
      'Acid-base equilibrium': "Acid-base equilibria involve the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])). The challenge is understanding the relationship between pH, pKa, and buffer capacity, especially in complex systems with multiple equilibria.",
